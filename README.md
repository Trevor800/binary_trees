Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science and are used to organize data hierarchically. A binary tree is composed of nodes, where each node can have at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and it has no parent. The nodes that do not have any children are called leaf nodes.
